# Lab5
Lab5 with Neculae Alexandra
While solving the lab we had no problems. The lab consisted of creating a ListView with different cars (which were added programmatically and subsequently from the user interface -via EditText and the add button-).
In addition to this, to make it look nicer, we added more pictures than the one I received at the lab and modified the UI colors.
After completing the two projects completely, I remembered some stuff used long ago and also learned a way to not crash my application when I have a lot of data in a listView.
